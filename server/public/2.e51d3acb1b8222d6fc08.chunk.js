I didn't know how hard it would actually be to learn a professional web development stack, but with help from the team, I am contributing code, testing the app, and finding and fixing issues. It also feels pretty awesome to help with the app because Udacity has been the best learning experience I've had as far as getting job ready skills to become a web developer, and I believe this app can help alumni take their skills to the next level! Alumni can contribute to this app, find projects to collaborate on with other alumni, and perhaps find a mentor or meetup."},{label:"Premium Poster",image:"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/75/93/83/759383c1c4e98c15c06c9af43fc84552.jpg",heading:"SadlyFake Demo-User",githubUrl:"https://github.com/udacityalumni",description:"I love blogging!
