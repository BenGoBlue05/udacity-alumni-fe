    description: "Helping out with the Udacity Alumni Web App is a great way to learn new skills and how to collaborate on a coding project with a team! I didn't know how hard it would actually be to learn a professional web development stack, but with help from the team, I am contributing code, testing the app, and finding and fixing issues. It also feels pretty awesome to help with the app because Udacity has been the best learning experience I've had as far as getting job ready skills to become a web developer, and I believe this app can help alumni take their skills to the next level! Alumni can contribute to this app, find projects to collaborate on with other alumni, and perhaps find a mentor or meetup.",

    description: "Contributing to the Alumni-Webapp taught me a lot about the joys and troubles of real-life collaborative Web-Development. Working with other Alumni is beautiful and there is a lot of positive support oozing out in all directions. Personally I wish that this webapp will further the possibilities to connect with each other and work on big useful projects as well as tiny playful ideas. : ) I hope that it will be a place to talk things over, get and give support, and simply appreciate each other's life and work.",
