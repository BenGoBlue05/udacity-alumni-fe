## LandingContainer
A higher order component that loads on the landing page.

### Example Usage

```js
<LandingContainer  />
```

### Other information
This is a higher order container that will pass state to any components that it needs to manage.

Redux handles the state of it, as you can see from the example.  Redux will be responsible for loading up data
to pass to its child components when we hook up the API.
