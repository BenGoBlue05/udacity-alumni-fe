/* contains all loading messages from the old Udacity classroom ("original")
and adaptations that refer to these messages. The latter are displayed in case
when there is a 404 error, alongside some links to educate yourself more.

This is both meant to be a nudge to those fun messages, and also an expression
of what I think is an essential trait that Udacity alumnis share:

We like it that there's always more to learn! :) */
