# Udacity Alumni Client App

## Getting Started
The project started as a fork of the [Scalable React Boilerplate](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate) project.  Please reference the repository for details on the features and conventions of the boilerplate.

### Installing
The package.json file includes over a dozen npm scripts to make most tasks a breeze.

Installation can be achieved by running
```
npm run setup
```

Also install webpack and webpack dev server globally.
```
npm install -g webpack-dev-server webpack
```

To get the development server running, please run
```
npm run start
```

and navigate to http://0.0.0.0:1337

To run the test suite, please run `npm run test`, which will pick up any file with the word 'test' in its name.

Again, please reference the [Scalable React Boilerplate](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate) project for details regarding the scripts.

## Deployment
The project will be deployed via Docker to an ExpressJS server.  Configuration will be included with the starter project.

## Built With
- Node
- React
- Redux
- Scalable React Boilerplate
